# Brexit vs Good Friday

Brexit Vs. Good Friday is a satirical representation of the current Brexit debacle and
Ireland’s core involvement in it due to the Good Friday Agreement. Brexit Vs. Good
Friday is a top-down shooter that will expand the genre and also involve the most loved
elements of other shooters.

The aim of the game is to protect Good Friday in a countdown until the UK leaves the
EU and therefore single market. If the player fails in their attempt by getting hit
then Good Friday will be removed and the player fails. If the player survives the
countdown then the Good Friday is upheld.
